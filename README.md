these are the projects that i restart my software journey with. i did some java and arduino, but i had to put it all on pause due to my mother's medical conditons and acedemic pressure. today is 19/06/2025 and i have some breathing room now and im ready to dive back in.

1) the first sort of project i made was yesterday, that is the 18/06/2025. a knock off wordle using java in vscode. i already have ideas on where i could improve and optimize the code, but im gonna post it here anyway.i didnt use any help from chatgpt other than getting a list of 100 common 5 letter words. i also didnt watch any youtube tutorials on how to make a worlde clone, i didnt search for how the original wordle was coded. i just dove right in to see if i could figure it out myself.
