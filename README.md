these are the projects that i restart my software journey with. i did some java and arduino, but i had to put it all on pause due to my mother's medical conditons and acedemic pressure. today is 19/06/2025 and i have some breathing room now and im ready to dive back in.

1) the first sort of project i made was yesterday, that is the 18/06/2025. a knock off wordle using java in vscode. i already have ideas on where i could improve and optimize the code, but im gonna post it here anyway.i didnt use any help from chatgpt other than getting a list of 100 common 5 letter words. i also didnt watch any youtube tutorials on how to make a worlde clone, i didnt search for how the original wordle was coded. i just dove right in to see if i could figure it out myself.
2) the rock paper scissors with GUI is my first experience with java swing and with GUIs in general. the PNG files for the 'game' , if we could call it that, were downloaded from PNGtree.com and the choices for the computer are made using a random number generator. this was meant for me to be a way to check if i am ready to dive into graphical user interfaces.
